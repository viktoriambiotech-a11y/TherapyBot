There's an underlying restlessness that\n    historically drove them to seek activity or distraction.\nSubstance Use History: The user has a history of alcohol use, with their longest streak\n    of sobriety being 2 weeks in ten years, indicating a long-standing pattern of use. They recently relapsed after 40 days of sobriety and describe\n    'back in the cycle of insanity.' They underwent a 21-day treatment program and attended AA/SMART recovery meetings, but stopped going\n    to the latter. They also attempted to quit multiple times and struggled with cravings even for non-alcoholic beverages resembling alcohol\n    early in sobriety.\nSignificant Life Events: The user reached out to their job for a Leave of Absence (LOA) to go to treatment due to being\n    'SO sad all the time' and feeling like a 'prisoner.' This marked a turning point in seeking help. No other specific major life events like job loss,\n    divorce, or trauma are explicitly mentioned as directly related to the addiction onset.\nBehavioral Themes: The user exhibits patterns of seeking\n    distraction ('constantly trying to distract myself with anything'), difficulty with stillness ('couldn't stand being still'), and using alcohol as\n    a coping mechanism for stress from a 'fast paced rather exhausting job.' Prior to sobriety, they were 'short tempered and didn't have patience for\n    anything or anyone.' During sobriety, they've noted being 'much calmer' and 'more content just sitting around.' They also show a need for\n    'controlled chaos' through activities like concerts. Relapse is a recurring theme, and they struggle with finding alternative routines for relaxation\n    and reward after work.\nMotivations for Alcohol Use: The user drank to cope with stress from their fast-paced job, finding it an 'everyday\n    thing because I would be so stressed out.' Alcohol was also used to socialize and feel happy, making 'things happy and everything was just a fun time.'\n    They also mention 'searching for anything to make me feel better internally' and escaping the feeling of being 'a fuck up.'\n    Boredom was 'excruciating' and led to drinking to avoid internal discomfort.\n    Current Motivation: Wants to reduce use but unsure about abstinence; worried about withdrawal, boredom, and social loss",

There's an underlying restlessness that\n    historically drove them to seek activity or distraction.\nSubstance Use History: The user has a history of alcohol use, with their longest streak\n    of sobriety being 2 weeks in ten years, indicating a long-standing pattern of use. They recently relapsed after 40 days of sobriety and describe\n    'back in the cycle of insanity.' They underwent a 21-day treatment program and attended AA/SMART recovery meetings, but stopped going\n    to the latter. They also attempted to quit multiple times and struggled with cravings even for non-alcoholic beverages resembling alcohol\n    early in sobriety.\nSignificant Life Events: The user reached out to their job for a Leave of Absence (LOA) to go to treatment due to being\n    'SO sad all the time' and feeling like a 'prisoner.' This marked a turning point in seeking help. No other specific major life events like job loss,\n    divorce, or trauma are explicitly mentioned as directly related to the addiction onset.\nBehavioral Themes: The user exhibits patterns of seeking\n    distraction ('constantly trying to distract myself with anything'), difficulty with stillness ('couldn't stand being still'), and using alcohol as\n    a coping mechanism for stress from a 'fast paced rather exhausting job.' Prior to sobriety, they were 'short tempered and didn't have patience for\n    anything or anyone.' During sobriety, they've noted being 'much calmer' and 'more content just sitting around.' They also show a need for\n    'controlled chaos' through activities like concerts. Relapse is a recurring theme, and they struggle with finding alternative routines for relaxation\n    and reward after work.\nMotivations for Alcohol Use: The user drank to cope with stress from their fast-paced job, finding it an 'everyday\n    thing because I would be so stressed out.' Alcohol was also used to socialize and feel happy, making 'things happy and everything was just a fun time.'\n    They also mention 'searching for anything to make me feel better internally' and escaping the feeling of being 'a fuck up.'\n    Boredom was 'excruciating' and led to drinking to avoid internal discomfort.\n    Current Motivation: Wants to reduce use but unsure about abstinence; worried about withdrawal, boredom, and social loss",
